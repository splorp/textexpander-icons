TextExpander Replacement Menu Bar Icons

About

-----------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been a satisfied customer of SmileOnMyMac’s TextExpander for
years. However, due to my interface persnicketiness I’ve never
really been happy with the selection of icons for the menu item.
They always felt a bit too large in the context of the menubar
and — quite frankly — a bit fuzzy looking.

After creating a revamped set of icons and posting the results to
Dribbble, I decided to make them available to everyone.

This project was subsequently forked by the lovely James Goode,
who added the nifty “Balloon” versions.

There are currently four sets of replacement icons:

+ Minimal Flat (Grant Hutchinson)

This set is the original, minimalist version that I had first
envisioned as a replacement. They have a simple, two dimensional
look with just a slight gradient shading.

+ Minimal Inset (Grant Hutchinson)

This set sports a subtle white “shadow” on the bottom edge,
mimicking the appearance of Apple’s menu extra icons. They use
the same gradient shading as the Minimal Flat version.

+ Balloon Flat (James Goode)

Created as an homage to TextExpander’s venerable balloon logo.
This set tries to match Apple’s menu bar icons as closely as
possible, eschewing the gradient shading found in the Minimal
version.

+ Balloon Inset (James Goode)

Identical to the Balloon Flat set, except for the addition of a
subtle white “shadow” on the bottom edge of the icons.
